        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0,112,192);">The UCLA Family STAR</span> (Stress, Trauma, and Resilience) Clinic provides evaluation and treatment services (individual therapy) for children and families affected by chronic stress, traumatic events, family medical/mental health illnesses, grief and loss, major family structural or life changes, and other circumstances experienced as traumatic by families and family members.
    	</p>
        <p>
        Children/adolescent psychiatrists and psychologists provide expertise and support for children and their family members experiencing chronic and/or traumatic stress due to adverse life experiences. STAR is also an educational resource and training clinic for UCLA Child Psychiatry Fellows and Psychology Interns. The clinic is located at UCLA, 760 Westwood Plaza in Westwood.

        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(0,112,192);">STAR Superparenting Group</span> helps parents with children experiencing significant stress, anxiety, or worry that is affecting their daily functioning. This group helps parents better understand the meaning behind their child&rsquo;s behavior, learn ways to develop consistency in parenting routines, and learn strategies that will help parents support children with managing stress and anxiety.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(0,112,192);">STAR Family Group</span> supports children ages 7-13 who have experienced or witnessed a stressful event and their parent(s)/caregiver(s). Children and caregiver(s) work together to overcome common family challenges that arise after a stressful event occurs. Families will identify and build on current strengths to improve stress management skills, increase positive family interactions, and support the parent-child relationship.
